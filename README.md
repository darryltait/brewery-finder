# brewery finder

Enter a city name to find breweries nearby.

## Technologies used:

- HTML5 - for page structure
- CSS3 - for page look and responsiveness
- JavaScript - for page interaction with user
- jQuery - for page interaction, especially with using AJAX to send/receive data to the API
- Google Fonts - for using custom fonts found on Google Fonts

## Approach taken:

I wanted to make an easy way to find local breweris in my city, or anywhere in the U.S., for that matter. By inputting a city, a list of local breweries will be returned.
